## Description
This web application provides useful tools and resources for people who are seeking mental health resources. More features are allowed for a registered user. A registered user can load "care contacts" (trusted individuals). If a user notices triggers for a mental health emergency, they can then use the app to drop their location to their care contacts as well as local community response teams. Registered users can also find local resources for drug/alcohol counseling assistance with a search class being "Partner/Spousal Support".
